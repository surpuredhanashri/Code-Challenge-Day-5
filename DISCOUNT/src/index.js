// Mr.Phileas Fogg is a very perfect man. He saves money even on petite things. 
// One day he heard a discount offer announced in a mall. 
// He wants to purchase lot of items to save his money. The discount is 
// given only when atleast two items are bought. 
// Since each item has different discount prices , 
// he finds difficult to check the amount he has saved.  
// So he approaches you to device a automated discount calculator to make him easy while billing.


//Write a function to return the Discount Amount
function find_DiscountAmount(item1, item2, disc_precent) {
    let discountAmount =
      item1 -
      disc_precent * (item1 / 100) +
      (item2 - disc_precent * (item2 / 100));
    return discountAmount;
  }
  
  //Write a function to return the discount percent
  function find_Discount(item1, item2, disc_precent) {
    let discountAmount =
      item1 -
      disc_precent * (item1 / 100) +
      (item2 - disc_precent * (item2 / 100));
  
    return parseFloat((item1 + item2 - discountAmount).toFixed(1));
  }
